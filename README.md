# Autonomous Mining Robot (minecraft / computer craft)
My first robot autonomy program from high school. Circa 2015.
Please forgive my egregious style errors and spelling mistakes.

MineSlaveOS.lua was designed to be run on a turtle.
MineControlConsoleOS.lua was designed to be run on a computer.

In order to get these to work they need to be placed in a specific starting configuration which I don't remember.
